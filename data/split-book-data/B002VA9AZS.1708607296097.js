window.bookSummaryJSON = "An amoral young tramp. A beautiful, sullen woman with an inconvenient husband. A problem that has only one, grisly solution; a solution that only creates other problems that no one can ever solve. <p>First published in 1934 and banned in Boston for its explosive mixture of violence and eroticism, <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i> is a classic of the roman noir. It established James M. Cain as a major novelist with an unsparing vision of America's bleak underside, and was acknowledged by Albert Camus as the model for <i>The Stranger</i>.</p>";
