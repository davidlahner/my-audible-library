window.bookSummaryJSON = "A fellow named Richard Bachman wrote <i>Blaze</i> in 1973 on an Olivetti typewriter, then turned the machine over to Stephen King, who used it to write <i>Carrie</i>. Bachman died in 1985 (from \"cancer of the pseudonym\"), but in late 2006, King found the original typescript of <i>Blaze</i> among his papers at the University of Maine's Fogler Library (\"How did this get here?!\") and decided that, with a little revision, it ought to be published. <p> <i>Blaze</i> is the story of Clayton Blaisdell, Jr., and of the crimes committed against him and the crimes he commits, including his last, the kidnapping of a baby heir worth millions. Blaze has been a slow thinker since childhood, when his father threw him down the stairs and then threw him down again. After escaping an abusive institution for boys when he was a teenager, Blaze hooks up with George, a seasoned criminal who thinks he has all the answers. But then George is killed, and Blaze, though haunted by his partner, is on his own.</p> <p> He becomes one of the most sympathetic criminals in all of literature. This is a crime story of surprising strength and sadness, with a suspenseful current sustained by the classic workings of fate and character, as taut and riveting as Stephen King's <i>The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon</i>.</p>";
