window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Growing up in a family of political journalists - and daughter of President Reagan’s White House social secretary - Ali Wentworth rebelled against her blue-blood upbringing, embracing Hollywood, motorcycles, even a few wildly inappropriate marriage proposals. Today she is an acclaimed comedic actress and writer, former Oprah regular, wife of political and media star George Stephanopoulos, and a mother who lets her two girls eat cotton candy before bed. Though she’s settled down, her rebellious nature thrives in her comedy and her view of her crazy world. </p> <p>In this addictively funny and warm memoir, she takes us through the looking glass and into the wonderland of her life, from a childhood among Washington’s elite to a stint in the psych ward they called a New England prep school; days doing L.A. sketch comedy (with then-aspiring artists Will Ferrell and Lisa Kudrow) to a series of spectacularly failed loves (that eventually led her to Mr. Right). Constant throughout is her mother, Muffie - a flawlessly elegant yet firm, no-nonsense force of nature and pure WASP convictions. </p> <p>As charming and off-the-wall as Ali herself, <i>Ali in Wonderland</i> is an entertaining look at life that is both intimate and hilarious. </p>";
