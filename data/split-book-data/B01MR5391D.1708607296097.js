Expect songs! They're what made up the previous five series, so it seems a pretty safe bet that that's what will be in this series as well. And, well, since you ask him for some tall tales.... </p> <p>Kicking off with a seasonal special, this series takes in TV adverts, woodland talent contests, a song about the best day of the Christmas season and what is almost certainly the greatest story a Finnemore has ever told. </p> <p>Described by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> as 'funny enough to make even the surliest cat laugh', John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme also features Margaret Cabourn-Smith, Simon Kane, Lawry Lewin, Carrie Quinlan and, at the piano, Susannah Pearse. </p>";
