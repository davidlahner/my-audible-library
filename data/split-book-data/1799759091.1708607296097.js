window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>\"What did you have? A boy or a girl?\"</i></b><b> Kyl and Brent imagined it would be years before their child would identify with a gender. Until then...</b></p> <p>As a first-time parent, Kyl Myers had one aspect dialed in from the start: not being beholden to the boy-girl binary, disparities, or stereotypes from the day a child is born. With no wish to eliminate gender but rather gender discrimination, Kyl and her husband, Brent, ventured off on a parenting path less traveled. Raising a confident, compassionate, and self-aware <i>person</i> was all that mattered.</p> <p>In this illuminating memoir, Kyl delivers a liberating portrait of a family's choice to dismantle the long-accepted and often-harmful social construct of what it means to be assigned a gender from birth. As a sociologist, Kyl explores the science of gender and sex and the adulthood gender inequities that start in childhood. As a loving parent, Kyl shares the joy of watching an amazing child named Zoomer develop their own agency to grow happily and healthily toward their own gender identity and expression.</p> <p>Candid and surprising, <i>Raising Them</i> is an inspiration to parents and to anyone open to understanding the limitless possibilities of being yourself.</p>";
