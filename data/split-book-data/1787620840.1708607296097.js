window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p><b>*A brand new collection of short stories from the incredible Sir Terry Pratchett!*</b></p> <p><i>Imagination is an amazing thing.</i><br> <br> It can take you to the top of the highest mountain, or down to the bottom of the deepest depths of the sea.<br> <br> This where it took Doggins on his Awfully Big Adventure: a quest full of magic and flying machines. (And the world’s best joke – trust me, it’s hilarious.)<br> <br> It took three young inventors to the moon (where they may or may not have left a bottle of lemonade) and a caveman on a trip to the dentist.<br> <br> You can join them on these adventures, and many more, in this incredible collection of stories . . .</p> <p><i>From the greatest imagination there ever was.</i></p> <p><b>Written for local newspapers when Terry Pratchett was a young lad, these never previously published stories are packed full of anarchic humour and wonderful wit.</b></p> <p><b>A must-have for Terry fans . . . and young listeners looking for a fix of magic.</b></p>";
