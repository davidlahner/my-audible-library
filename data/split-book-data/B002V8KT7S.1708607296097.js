window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Road Rage</i> unites Richard Matheson's classic <i>Duel</i> and the contemporary work it inspired...two power-packed short stories by three of the genre's most acclaimed authors. <p><i>Duel</i>, an unforgettable tale about a driver menaced by a semi truck, was the source for Stephen Spielberg's acclaimed first film of the same name. <i>Throttle</i>, by Stephen King and Joe Hill, is a duel of a different kind, pitting a faceless trucker against a tribe of motorcycle outlaws, in the simmering Nevada desert. Their battle is fought out on 20 miles of the most lonely road in the country, a place where the only thing worse than not knowing what you're up against is slowing down.</p>";
