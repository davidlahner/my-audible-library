window.bookSummaryJSON = "Have you ever slathered mustard on a hotdog and thought, \"Wow, I sure hope the company that made this condiment isn't a corrupt tech startup run by a CEO who is a tyrannical chauvinist!\" Well, you're about to... Starry-eyed Emery is thrilled to start her new job as the first female engineer at condiment startup <i>Yes We Mustard</i>. Their product, \"The People's Mustard\" is hugely popular; it's delicious, all-natural, produced ethically, and definitely not corrupt in any way. Yes We Mustard is a Silicon Valley darling run by a wunderkind of a CEO, and no one - least of all the people who work there - know how they do it. Emery's dream is to \"make the world a better place,\" as she tells her long-distance boyfriend, and she believes this new position might be the first step to making that dream a reality. But Emery's hopes are soon to be dashed. Starting day one, she realizes her expectations may have been a bit too high. Her boss is MIA, a female coworker is out to get her, and her desk is a…cardboard box? But it only gets worse from there. As negative press about Yes We Mustard begins to circulate, one journalist, in particular, seems to have it out for the company, but where is she getting her information? Emery sticks to her guns - Yes We Mustard is saving the world, possibly even more than Goop does! She doesn't trust the bad press… until she does. One day, Emery discovers a secret that could destroy Yes We Mustard. The CEO, desperate to silence her, offers her career glory in return for her closed lips. Will she do what it takes to succeed in Silicon Valley, or is she simply not cut out for the cutthroat mustard-tech biz? <i>Yes We Mustard</i> is a workplace satire that explores the evils of Silicon Valley, how the tech industry talks about women, big egos, and Bad Mustard. Before making the leap into writing, creator Ginny Hogan was a Silicon Valley data scientist, and so she's no stranger to the types of characters depicted on this show. Told through a creative mix of emails, Slack messages, podcast recordings, company-wide speeches, and articles, Yes We Mustard is a witty, rollicking, and absurdist deep-dive into a fictionalized Silicon Valley company.";
