The duke is a surprisingly genial man whose court brings all the fanciness and fun of Persephone’s high society but little of the pretension—and, most importantly, he’s got the promise of more work.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Some fine hospitality</b><br> Obliged to stick around while Inara is with a client—and hoping to score future employment—the crew settles in.
