window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do you believe in magic? Can you imagine a war between wizards? An exciting journey in an airship or down in a submarine? Would you like to meet the fastest truncheon in the Wild West? </p> <p><i>The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner and Other Stories</i> is the second fabulously funny short story collection from the late acclaimed storyteller Terry Pratchett. A follow-up to <i>Dragons at Crumbling Castle</i>, this second batch of storytelling gems features stories written when Sir Terry was just 17 years old and working as a junior reporter. In this audiobook new Pratchett fans will find wonder, mayhem, sorcery, and delight - and loyal listeners will recognize the seeds of ideas that went on to influence his most beloved tales later in life. </p> <p>As Neil Gaiman says, \"A Terry Pratchett book is a small miracle\" - and <i>The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner and Other Stories</i> proves to be another miracle taking its place alongside Pratchett's astounding and cherished body of work. </p>";
