Storms, lovable psychiatric hospital escapee, zoom along at breakneck speed, delivering laughs and shocks in droves.

Since it's always a good idea to fly under police radar, Serge figures the Keys are just the place to lie low. Plus, he has two missions to accomplish: re-invent himself and get married, although he hasn't picked the lucky lady yet. But what he doesn't know is that enough serial and spree killers are headed his way to have a parade of psychopaths. Are the Keys big enough for all the lunatics?";
