window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Factfulness</i>: The stress-reducing habit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.&nbsp;</p> <p>When asked simple questions about global trends - why the world's population is increasing; how many young women go to school; how many of us live in poverty - we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Factfulness</i>, Professor of International Health and a man who can make data sing, Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens, and reveals the 10 instincts that distort our perspective.&nbsp;</p> <p>It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.&nbsp;</p> <p>Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, <i>Factfulness</i> is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world.&nbsp;</p>";
