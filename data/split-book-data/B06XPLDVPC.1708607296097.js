window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The little town of Castle Rock, Maine, has witnessed some strange events and unusual visitors over the years, but there is one story that has never been told...until now. </p> <p>There are three ways up to Castle View from the town of Castle Rock: Route 117, Pleasant Road, and the Suicide Stairs. Every day in the summer of 1974, 12-year-old Gwendy Peterson has taken the stairs, which are held by strong (if time-rusted) iron bolts and zigzag up the cliffside. </p> <p>At the top of the stairs, Gwendy catches her breath and listens to the shouts of the kids on the playground. From a bit farther away comes the chink of an aluminum bat hitting a baseball as the Senior League kids practice for the Labor Day charity game. </p> <p>One day a stranger calls to Gwendy: \"Hey, girl. Come on over here for a bit. We ought to palaver, you and me.\" </p> <p>On a bench in the shade sits a man in black jeans, a black coat like for a suit, and a white shirt unbuttoned at the top. On his head is a small, neat black hat. The time will come when Gwendy has nightmares about that hat.... </p> <p>Journey back to Castle Rock again in this chilling new novella by Stephen King, best-selling author of <i>The Bazaar of Bad Dreams</i>, and Richard Chizmar, award-winning author of <i>A Long December</i>. This book will be a Cemetery Dance Publications exclusive with no other editions currently planned anywhere in the world! </p> <p>INCLUDES A CONVERSATION BETWEEN STEPHEN KING &amp; RICHARD CHIZMAR! </p>";
