window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is the second series of one-off comedies written by the genius behind the smash-hit radio sitcom <i>Cabin Pressure</i> - John Finnemore. The first series won the coveted Writers Guild of Great Britain award for Best Comedy. </p> <p>Each show is a comedy perfumed by just two actors - including (across the series) famous household names such as Martin Clunes (<i>Doc Martin</i>), Julia McKenzie (<i>Fresh Fields</i>) and the inimitable voice of Carolyn in <i>Cabin Pressure</i>, Stephanie Cole. </p> <p>The show comes from Pozzitive, proud producers of <i>Cabin Pressure</i>, <i>Thanks A Lot</i>, <i>Milton Jones!</i>, <i>Jeremy Hardy Speaks To The Nation</i>, <i>The Brig Society</i>, <i>The Castle</i>, <i>Armando Iannucci's Charm Offensive</i>, <i>Shush!</i> and <i>Kevin Eldon Will See You Now</i>.... </p> <p>Stephanie Cole and Kerry Godliman (<i>Derek</i>) star in the first episode - 'The Queen's Speech' - Victoria is very much hoping to see a conjuror, or at the very least a parrot - but instead meets Mabel.... </p> <p>In Episode 2, Julia McKenzie (<i>Fresh Fields</i>) and Gus Brown star in 'Mercy Dash' - Malcolm needs some help. Sue has a spot of time on her hands. Winchester beckons.... </p> <p>In the third show, newcomers Kieran Hodgson (2017 South Bank Arts - Breakthrough Comedy Award) and Ethan Lawrence (<i>Bad Education</i>) are Pidge and Gavin in 'Here's What We Do' - Pidge and Gavin! The old team back together again for one last mission.... </p> <p>And Show 4 pairs the inimitable Una Stubbs (<i>Sherlock</i>) and Tamzin Outhwaite (<i>Redcap</i>) in 'The Rebel Alliance' - Eileen and Lizzie are both determined to enjoy the wedding. No matter what Yvonne does.... </p> <p>Show 5 stars Martin Clunes (<i>Doc Martin</i>) and Tom Goodman-Hill (<i>Humans</i>) with a bit of 'Penguin Diplomac'\"- when a chance meeting between Søndergaard and Bunning could very well lead to a new Cold War.... </p> <p>And John Finnemore himself stars in the final show alongside comedy hero Michael Palin in 'The Wroxton Box' - Alec is late as usual. But Percy is wearing different socks. Something big is brewing.... </p> <p>Duration: 3 hours approx. </p>";
