BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (</b><b><i>Love Actually</i></b><b>; </b><b><i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i></b><b>; </b><b><i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i></b><b>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (</b><b><i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i></b><b>; </b><b><i>Shaun of the Dead</i></b><b>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</b></p> <p><b>'Darkness isn't the opposite of light, it is simply its absence...what was radiating from the book was the light that lies on the far side of darkness, the light fantastic.'</b></p> <p>The Discworld is in danger, heading towards a seemingly inevitable collision with a malevolent red star, its magic fading. It needs a hero, and fast.</p> <p>What it doesn't need is Rincewind, an inept and cowardly wizard who is still recovering from the trauma of falling off the edge of the world. Or Twoflower, the well-meaning tourist whose luggage has a mind (and legs) of its own.</p> <p>Which is a shame, because that's all there is....</p> <p><i>The Light Fantastic</i> is the second book in the Wizards series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order. The first book in the Discworld series—<i>The Colour of Magic</i>—was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.&nbsp;</p>";
