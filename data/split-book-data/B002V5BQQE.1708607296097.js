window.bookSummaryJSON = "Welcome to Echo Falls. Home of a thousand secrets, where Ingrid Levin-Hill, super sleuth, never knows what will happen next. <p>Ingrid is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Or at least her shoes are. Getting them back means getting involved in a murder investigation rivaling those solved by her idol, Sherlock Holmes, and Ingrid has enough on her plate with club soccer, school, and the plum role of Alice in the Echo Falls production of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. But much as in Alice's adventures down the rabbit hole, things in Ingrid's small town keep getting curiouser and curiouser.</p>";
