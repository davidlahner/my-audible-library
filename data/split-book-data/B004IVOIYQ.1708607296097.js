window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A BBC Radio 4 full-cast dramatisation of a classic Agatha Christie mystery, starring Lyndsey Marshal, Geoffrey Whitehead, and John Rowe. </p> <p>Ten guests travel to an island at the invitation of someone named U. N. Owen. All are strangers, but they have two things in common: they have all been responsible for someone's death, and none will leave the island alive. Over the next two days and nights, each of the guests is killed off in a different manner in keeping with the nursery rhyme, 'Ten Little Soldier Boys'. As they are picked off one by one, who could possibly be responsible?</p> <p>The killers are forced to turn detective so they can find the unknown murderer, but one by one they become victims. </p> <p>Billed as 'the famous detective story without a detective', <i>And Then There Were None</i> is one of Agatha Christie's darkest and most enduring tales.</p>";
