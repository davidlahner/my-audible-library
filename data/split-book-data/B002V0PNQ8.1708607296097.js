window.bookSummaryJSON = "Not just anyone can be a knight, and this spell-binding collection of action-packed stories from around the world will show you why. Narrated by Anthony Head (who played Giles on TV's <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>) <i>Knights</i> is the absorbing tale of young Tom of Warwick who is sent to his local castle to learn the art of knighthood. <p> Tom's adventures, and the stories he hears from Master William about knights from many traditions, will delight and enthrall young would-be knights everywhere. From the familiar court of King Arthur to the distant realm of Prince Vladimir of Kiev, this enticing collection reveals that being a good knight is harder than it may seem. Not only are a brave heart and a strong arm required, but it is also necessary to know your own weaknesses, learn to cooperate with others and even, at times, have a good sense of humor!</p>";
