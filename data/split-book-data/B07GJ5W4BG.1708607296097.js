window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Living and slaving in Fill City One, you get used to the smell. We call it the Everpresent Stink. But every once in a while, on a spring day with a breeze, it clears away enough to remind us that there is something more out there.&nbsp;Most Fillers' wildest dreams would be just to get past the walls and live in the mainland. But my dream? It’s a little bigger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m going to Mars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Well, I’m only going to Mars if I can find a winning Red Scarab to get on Zach Larson’s crazy reality show. And then I’ll have to figure out how to escape this hellhole. And then compete on live television for three months. And somehow win a spot on the crew of the very first manned mission to Mars. Oh, and one more slight obstacle? There might be a reason that by 2085 a human still hasn’t set foot on the Red Planet. A dangerous reason. A reason worth killing for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>You’re Going to Mars!</i> Rob Dircks, Audible best-selling author of <i>Where the Hell Is Tesla?</i>, creates a near-future filled with family (the good kind and the insufferable kind), pop divas, mobsters, and the world’s first trillionaire - and sends them all on a science fiction odyssey/comedy/love story/adventure that will change their world forever.</p>";
