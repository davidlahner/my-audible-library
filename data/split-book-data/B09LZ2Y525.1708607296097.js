BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</p> <p>'You can't go around building a better world for people. Only people can build a better world for people. Otherwise, it's just a cage.'</p> <p>There's power in stories. The Fairy Godmother is good. The servant girl marries the Prince. Everyone lives happily ever after...don't they?</p> <p>The witches Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick are travelling to far-distant Genua to stop a wedding and save a kingdom. But how do you fight a happy-ever-after, especially when it comes with glass slippers and a power-hungry Fairy Godmother who has made Destiny an offer it can't refuse?</p> <p>It's hard to resist a good story, even when the fate of the kingdom depends on it....</p> <p><i>Witches Abroad</i> is the third book in the Witches series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</p> <p>The first book in the Discworld series – <i>The Colour of Magic</i> – was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
