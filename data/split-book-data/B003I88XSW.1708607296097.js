window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ</i> is the remarkable new piece of fiction from best-selling and famously atheistic author Philip Pullman. By challenging the events of the gospels, Pullman puts forward his own compelling and plausible version of the life of Jesus, and in so doing, does what all great books do: makes the reader ask questions.</p> <p>In Pullman’s own words, “The story I tell comes out of the tension within the dual nature of Jesus Christ, but what I do with it is my responsibility alone. Parts of it read like a novel, parts like history, and parts like a fairy tale; I wanted it to be like that because it is, among other things, a story about how stories become stories.”</p> <p>Written with unstinting authority, <i>The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ</i> is a pithy, erudite, subtle, and powerful book by a controversial and beloved author.</p>";
