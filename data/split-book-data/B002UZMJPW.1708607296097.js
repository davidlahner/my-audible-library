The last few years have been good for Cery. He has a respected position among the Thieves, and connections in high and low places. When an exotic stranger offers to help him with a secret task, Cery knows he should refuse, but life would be boring without the occasional risk... <p>As Akkarin reveals more, Sonea does not know what to believe or what she fears most - that the truth is as terrifying as he claims or that he is trying to make her his accomplice in black magic.</p>";
