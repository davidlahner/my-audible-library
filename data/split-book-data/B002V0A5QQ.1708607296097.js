window.bookSummaryJSON = "Hailed by Henry James as \"the finest piece of imaginative writing yet put forth in the country\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> reaches to our nation's historical and moral roots for the material of great tragedy. <p>Set in an early New England colony, the novel shows the terrible impact a single, passionate act has on the lives of three members of the community: the fiery, tortured Reverend Dimmesdale; the obsessed, vengeful Chillingworth; and the defiant Hester Prynne, who, unwilling to name her partner in adultery, is condemned to wear a scarlet \"A\" on the breast of her gown for the remainder of her life.</p> <p>With <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, Hawthorne became the first American novelist to forge from our Puritan heritage a universal classic, a masterful exploration of humanity's unending struggle with sin, guilt, and pride.</p>";
