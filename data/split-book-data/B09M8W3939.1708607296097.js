window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>The audiobook of <i>Moving Pictures</i> is narrated by Jason Isaacs, best known for playing Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter film series, and for his starring roles in <i>The Death of Stalin</i> and <i>Case Histories</i>. BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</p> <p><b>'HOLY WOOD IS A DIFFERENT SORT OF PLACE... HERE, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE IMPORTANT.'</b></p> <p>A new phenomenon is taking over the Discworld: moving pictures. Created by the alchemists of Ankh-Morpork, the growing 'clicks' industry moves to the sandy land of Holy Wood, attracted by the light of the sun and some strange calling no one can quite put their finger on...</p> <p>Also drawn to Holy Wood are aspiring young stars Victor Tugelbend, a wizarding student dropout, and Theda 'Ginger' Withel, a small-town girl with big dreams.</p> <p>But behind the glitz and glamour of the clicks, a sinister presence lurks. Because belief is powerful in the Discworld, and sometimes downright dangerous...</p> <p>The magic of movies might just unravel reality itself.</p> <p>The Discworld novels can be read in any order but <i>Moving Pictures</i> is a standalone.</p> <p>The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
