window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A 2020 Audie finalist - narration by author</b></p> <p><b>Famed American actress Demi Moore at last tells her own story in a surprisingly intimate and emotionally charged memoir.</b></p> <p>For decades, Demi Moore has been synonymous with celebrity. From iconic film roles to high-profile relationships, Moore has never been far from the spotlight - or the headlines.</p> <p>Even as Demi was becoming the highest paid actress in Hollywood, however, she was always outrunning her past, just one step ahead of the doubts and insecurities that defined her childhood.&nbsp;Throughout her rise to fame and during some of the most pivotal moments of her life, Demi battled addiction, body image issues, and childhood trauma that would follow her for years - all while juggling a skyrocketing career and at times negative public perception.&nbsp;As her success grew, Demi found herself questioning if she belonged in Hollywood, if she was a good mother, a good actress - and, always, if she was simply good enough.</p> <p>As much as her story is about adversity, it is also about tremendous resilience. In this deeply candid and reflective memoir, Demi pulls back the curtain and opens up about her career and personal life - laying bare her tumultuous relationship with her mother, her marriages, her struggles balancing stardom with raising a family, and her journey toward openheartedness. <i>Inside Out</i> is a story of survival, success, and surrender - a wrenchingly honest portrayal of one womanâ€™s at once ordinary and iconic life.</p>";
