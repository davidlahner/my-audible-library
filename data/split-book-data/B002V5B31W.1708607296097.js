window.bookSummaryJSON = "\"I think he was dead before I shot him.\" <p>With these auspicious words begins a murder mystery so utterly unlike any other that it took 15 of Ireland's finest writers (working well below their peak) to bring it to its unlikely conclusion. The plot involves a mad search for the only manuscript of an unpublished novel by James Joyce, and features a stellar cast - including a sadistic sergeant with the unlikely name of Andy Andrews and the unforgettable mob boss Mrs. Bloom, a woman \"who had tried everything but drew the line at honesty.\" Raucous, raunchy, gratuitously violent and completely hilarious, <i>Yeats Is Dead!</i> is a diabolically entertaining mulligan stew of a novel. James Joyce would be proud.</p> <p><i>Yeats is Dead!</i> was edited by <b>Joseph O'Connor</b>, whose novels include <i>Cowboys and Indians</i>, <i>Desperadoes</i>, <i>The Salesman</i> and <i>Inishowen</i>.</p> <p>The narrator, <b>Ciraran O'Reilly</b>'s, stage performances include <i>The Irish and How They Got That Way</i>, <i>The Corn is Green</i>, and <i>Da, Summer</i>. His film include <i>The Devil's Own</i> and <i>A Further Gesture</i> and he has appeared on television in <i>Law and Order SVU</i>, <i>One Life to Live</i>, and <i>As The World Turns</i>.
