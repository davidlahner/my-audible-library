window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After the Robinsons - a minister, his wife, and their 4 young sons - are shipwrecked on a desert island, they must adapt to their new environment, which includes exotic birds and animals, but none of the comforts they enjoyed in their native Switzerland. Without modern conveniences or even clocks and calendars, the Robinsons must use common sense to build a home, find food, and tame the island's wild animals. Through their struggles and achievements, the courageous family not only survives, but finds a spiritual happiness that they never experienced in their civilized homeland.</p>";
