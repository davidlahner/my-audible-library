window.bookSummaryJSON = "Jo Larouche has lived her 13 years in the California desert with her Aunt Lily, ever since she was dropped on Lily's doorstep with this note: \"This is Jo. Please take care of her. But beware. This is a dangerous baby. \"<p>At Lily's annual Christmas costume party, a variety of strange events take place that lead Jo and Lily out of California forever - and into the mysterious, strange, fantastical world of Eldritch City. There, Jo learns the scandalous truth about who she is, and she and Lily join the Order of Odd-Fish, a collection of knights who research useless information. Glamorous cockroach butlers, pointless quests, obsolete weapons, and bizarre festivals fill their days, but two villains are controlling their fate. Jo is inching closer and closer to the day when her destiny is fulfilled, and no one in Eldritch City will ever be the same.</p>";
