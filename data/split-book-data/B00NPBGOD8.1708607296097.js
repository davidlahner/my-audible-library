window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A collection of essays and other nonfiction from Terry Pratchett, spanning the whole of his writing career from his early years to the present day. </p> <p>Terry Pratchett has earned a place in the hearts of listeners the world over with his best-selling Discworld series - but in recent years he has become equally well-known and respected as an outspoken campaigner for causes including Alzheimer's research and animal rights. <i>A Slip of the Keyboard</i> brings together for the first time the finest examples of Pratchett's nonfiction writing, both serious and surreal: from musings on mushrooms to what it means to be a writer (and why banana daiquiris are so important); from memories of Granny Pratchett to speculation about Gandalf's love life, and passionate defences of the causes dear to him. </p> <p>With all the humour and humanity that have made his novels so enduringly popular, this collection brings Pratchett out from behind the scenes of the Discworld to speak for himself - man and boy, bibliophile and computer geek, champion of hats, orangutans and Dignity in Dying. </p> <p><i>Snuff</i> was the best-selling adult hardcover novel of 2011. <i>A Blink of the Screen</i>, Terry's short fiction collection, was also one of the best-selling hardcovers of 2012.</p>";
