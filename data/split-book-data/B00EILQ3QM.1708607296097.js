window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Multi-Voiced Performance, 2014</b></p> <p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Audio Drama, 2014</b></p> <p><b>Award-winning author, narrator, and screenwriter Neil Gaiman personally selected this book, and, using the tools of the Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX), produced this work for his audiobook label, Neil Gaiman Presents. </b></p> <p><b>A few words from Neil on <i>The Fall of the Kings:</i></b> \"In the Riverside chronology of events, The Fall of the Kings takes place a generation after <i>Swordspoint</i>. If you are new to the world of Riverside, I hope the richness of this book will surprise and delight you, with multi-voiced scenes set like jewels in the gold of Ellen Kushner's narrationâ€¦.\" </p> <p>In this stunning follow-up to Kushner's <i>The Privilege of the Sword</i> and the Audie-award winning <i>Swordspoint,</i> co-author Delia Sherman (<i>The Freedom Maze</i>) joins Ellen to return to that world of labyrinthine intrigue, where sharp swords and even sharper wits rule. This time, they explore the city's University, where a troubled young nobleman and his scholar lover find themselves playing out an ancient drama destined to explode their society's smug view of itself. </p> <p>In a city grown decadent, myth and magic begin to seep through the ancient stones. Generations ago the last king fell. But the blood of kings runs deep in the land - and the key may be Theron Campion of Tremontaine, a louche beauty of questionable morals seeking to escape his family heritage in the University lecture halls. When he and renegade scholar Basil St. Cloud come together, they discover that the price of uncovering ancient history may be to be forced to repeat it.... </p> <p>Sue Zizza of SueMedia Productions creates some truly stunning sound elements, including a full score of original music by composer Nathanael Tronerud commissioned for this series... with a full supporting cast who bring to life the rich tapestry of passionate University scholars, noblemen in brothels and Riverside lowlifes, in the sophisticated urban setting that Kushner's many fans have come to love.</p>";
