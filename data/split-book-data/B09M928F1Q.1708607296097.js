But when a fellow private eye asks him to look into it, and he learns the gang was doing a charity run for a church - a church Jimmy knows quite well - when they were attacked, his professional curiosity is raised.</p> <p>But his investigation quickly leads to a tangled maze of clues and dead ends. Someone - or something - is prowling the streets of Puyallup, looking to incinerate whoever crosses their path. And Jimmy’s got to find them - and stop them - before the entire neighborhood goes up in flames.</p> <p>But whoever’s looking to light innocent victims on fire made one mistake - they’re doing it in Kincaid’s backyard. And Jimmy’s never taken kindly to trespassers....</p>";
