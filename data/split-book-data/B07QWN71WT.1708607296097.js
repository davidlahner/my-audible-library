window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The coldest shadows.</b></p> <p>Arcano-archaeologist Elijah knows that digging into the past can be its own reward - or peril. When he’s hired to find an ancient map purported to lead to a mysterious location at the bottom of the world, his professional curiosity is more than roused. But his quest to simply get his hands on the map is more dangerous than he expected - even for a shadowrunner. He and his own team of runners - including everything from a goblin rigger to a troll street samurai - follow a murky trail that takes them from the ruins of Chicago to the jungles of Amazonia. Along the way, they discover that they’re not the only ones looking for this map - and that it may lead to a treasure even greater than anyone could have known. Elijah and his crew plan to get both the map and to its riches first - assuming they survive the very dangerous road trip to get there....</p>";
