window.bookSummaryJSON = "Listen to mystery stories by today's top writers and the masters who inspired them. The idea for this collection came to Mystery Writers of America Grandmaster Lawrence Block when he was asked, \"What is your favorite mystery story?\" Block compiled this unique collection by posing the same question to some of today's favorite writers of the genre. You'll hear: Peter Lovesey's \"The Crime of Miss Oyster Brow\" paired with Donald Westlake's \"Too Many Crooks\"; Stephen King's \"The Wedding Gig\" and one of his favorites, \"Murder-Two\" by Joyce Carol Oates; \"En Famille\" by Ed Gorman beside Stephen Crane's \"The Blue Hotel\"; Tony Hillerman's \"First Lead Gasser\" and \"Goodbye, Pops\" by Joe Gores; and \"High Stakes\" by John Lutz with W.F. Harvey's \"August Heat.\" Certain to delight, enthrall, startle, and entertain, <i>Master's Choice</i> is a tribute to the enduring art of storytelling.";
