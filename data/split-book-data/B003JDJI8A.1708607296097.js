Virtuous Laura has grown up in a solitary castle and longs for a close friend. Her wish seems granted with the arrival of a beautiful and mysterious stranger named Carmilla. A friendship develops but the brooding mood and sexual overtones mar Laura's happiness. Will she escape with her life and spirit? </p> <p>Megan Follows' brilliant reading perfectly evokes the dramatic atmosphere of this Gothic Victorian tale.
